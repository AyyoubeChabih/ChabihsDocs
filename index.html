					For administrators and web developers alike, there are some important bits of information you should familiarize yourself with before starting out. This document serves as a brief introduction to some of the concepts and terminology behind the Tomcat container. As well, where to go when you need help.
				</span>
				<span class="title">Terminology</span>
				<span class="text">
					In the course of reading these documents, you will run across a number of terms; some specific to Tomcat, and others defined by the Servlet and JSP specifications.

					Context - In a nutshell, a Context is a web application.
					That is it. If you find any more terms we need to add to this section, please do let us know.
				</span>
				<span class="title">Directories and Files</span>
				<span class="text">
					Throughout the docs, you'll notice there are numerous references to <b>$CATALINA_HOME</b>. This represents the root of your Tomcat installation. When we say, "This information can be found in your <b>$CATALINA_HOME/README.txt</b> file" we mean to look at the <b>README.txt</b> file at the root of your Tomcat install. Optionally, Tomcat may be configured for multiple instances by defining <b>$CATALINA_BASE</b> for each instance. If multiple instances are not configured, <b>$CATALINA_BASE</b> is the same as <b>$CATALINA_HOME</b>.

					These are some of the key tomcat directories:
					<ul>
					<li><b>/bin</b>- Startup, shutdown, and other scripts. The *.sh files (for Unix systems) are functional duplicates of the *.bat files (for Windows systems). Since the Win32 command-line lacks certain functionality, there are some additional files in here.</li>
					<li><b>/conf</b> - Configuration files and related DTDs. The most important file in here is server.xml. It is the main configuration file for the container.</li>
					<li><b>/logs</b> - Log files are here by default.</li>
					<li><b>/webapps</b> - This is where your webapps go.</li>
					</ul>
